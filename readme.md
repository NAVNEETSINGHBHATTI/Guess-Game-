# 🏆 Guess's The Number Game 


A simple and interactive number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. After each guess, the game provides feedback—whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game also tracks the number of attempts and allows the player to restart and play again.
